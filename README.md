# Faux Fliers

**Faux Fliers** is an arcade action flier where you fix your plane as you fly it.

## Getting Started

* Github Desktop (not the old version)
* Unity 2017.3
* Visual Studio 2017 (if Community is required, go ahead and do so)
* Android Studio
* Unity Remote

### Installing

## Versioning

Team Giga uses [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for game development. The following is subject to change as issues may arise.

Given the version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:
* **MAJOR** version when creating a public build for the game's initial release, or when a new public update is released. (Ex. Public release, New Map & Items Update, etc.)
* **MINOR** version when a new feature is implemented internally.
* **PATCH** version when at least one bug is fixed.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the format. (Ex. v1.0.0-alpha, v1.2.0-beta.1)
